## Project Description

In this study, we have used publicly available mass-spectrometry data from pride to investigate the biological importance of protein co-occurrence in various experiments. To calculate the statistical weight of protein co-occurrence we have used Jaccard similarity method. Protein pairs with a similarity above 0.4 were mapped to knowledgebases; [Uniprot] (http://www.uniprot.org/), [Reactome] (http://www.reactome.org), [Ensembl] (http://www.ensembl.org), [IntAct] (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/), [BioGRID] (https://thebiogrid.org/), and [CORUM] (http://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/corum/), to assign potential biological relevance. Moreover, using published articles and [String] (http://string-db.org/) database, we were able to determine the possible biological connection between unannotated protein pairs with no known biological correspondence.
